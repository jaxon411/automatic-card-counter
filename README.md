## ♦ Motivation and Goal ♦

This project was born from the combination of my love of Blackjack with my love of neural netwokrs. Image classifcation has always been a fun an interesting persuit for me, but this was my first time attempting object classification.

My ultimate goal was to create a playing card detection model trained to recognize cards on a table, count cards based on a proven card counting system, and display what the player should do given the current hand. I'm happy to report that I was successful!
